# TaskCLI – Web-Based Command Line Task Manager

TaskCLI is a **minimal, CLI-style task manager** built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
It simulates a **real command-line interface inside the browser**, focusing on **logic, clarity, and professional GitHub collaboration practices**.

This project is intentionally simple in features but **strong in fundamentals**, making it ideal for academic use, learning GitHub workflows, and portfolio demonstration.
